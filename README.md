Destiny Linux Unpacker 
======================

This is a fully-functional Linux unpacker for Destiny 1 and 2, written in Ada.  
It makes use of Linoodle (https://www.github.com/McSimp/linoodle) in order to
interface with Oodle, the compressor used by Destiny.

>	Note: To comply with legal requirements, only use this program for personal,
>	educative purposes and to bolster interoperability of Destiny (2) with other
>	programs. Do not publish the contents of any Destiny package files without
>	Bungie's explicit permission.

Setup and Usage
---------------

If you would like to build from source, see that section. Otherwise,
download a release from the Releases section (if available).

Destiny 1 and 2 packages are compressed with a library called Oodle, which is
distributed under an all rights reserved license and thus cannot be included.

In order to decompress files, do the following:  
	- If you intend to use Destiny 1 or Destiny 2 before Beyond Light,
	acquire oo2core_3_win64.dll and place it in the same directory as the tool.  
	- If you intend to use Destiny 2 after Beyond Light,
	acquire oo2corelinux64.so.9 and replace the dummy file in ext_lib.  
To acquire oo2core_3_win64.dll, just look inside the bin directory of the Destiny 2 Shadowkeep
depot folder.  
To acquire oo2corelinux64.so.9, follow the instructions at https://github.com/gildor2/UEViewer/tree/master/libs/oodle.
>	Note: This program is for use for educational purposes only.
>	RADÂ Game Tools, Epic Game Tools, etc. reserve the right to define the terms under which users may
>	use Oodle and related software, to which they own the copyright.
>	If unsure, you might consider purchasing a license to Oodle 2.9.

Run the program with no arguments to see the available options and syntax.

If any errors occur during unpacking, please add them to an Issue so I can investigate.  

Building from Source
--------------------

To build from source, you'll need GNAT 2021 (FSF or GPL).
Use `./ext_src/build_linoodle.sh` to setup linoodle (it requires Ninja, and CMake)
OpenSSL (libcrypto) is needed for encryption. This can be manually removed if you only need D1 support.
Finally, run `gprbuild -Pdestiny_unpacker` to build an executable.

Follow the instructions above to acquire Oodle support. This is technically not necessary if you only want to extract WEM files.  
If you do not wish to include oo2corelinux64.so.9, run `./ext_src/build_oo2coredummy.sh`  
Doing this will effectively remove post-Beyond Light support, however it may be necessary if you are unable to acquire the necessary libraries.

>	Note: Even though this program is licensed under the GPL, its linking with Oodle makes the actual license unclear.
>	I optionally make this program available under the terms of the LGPL for anyone whom that would assist.

Reference
---------

Currently supported versions of the game are d1be (Destiny 1 Big Endian / PS3), d1 (Destiny 1 Little Endian / PS4),
prebl (Destiny 2 before Beyond Light), and postbl (Destiny 2 after Beyond Light).  

Currently available optional file formats are wem (raw audio), bnk (WWise composition format), usm (cutscene format), vox (voice line references), txt (string files and references), and unk (everything else).  

If you would like to decode string files, please use https://github.com/andrewathalye/destiny-string-tool, as these have a convoluted format.  
If you need to convert WEM files to OGG, please use <not yet available>.  
If you need to convert BNK files to a textual representation, please try WWiser or https://github.com/andrewathalye/wwtools-ada/

Additionally, I give my thanks to McSimp and https://github.com/McSimp/linoodle, without which
I would have been unable to decompress txtp files on Linux
